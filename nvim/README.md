What do I want in an IDE?

* Fuzzy search everything
    * Shortcuts and features
    * Symbols: constants, variables & functions
    * Buffers
    * Files in computer, directory, and project
    * String inside buffer/file
    * Vim commands
    * Projects and sessions
* Code navigation
    * History: Jumping back and forth between functions and variable usages and all the jumping's in history!
    * Filename/module rename/refactor
    * Local variable rename/refactor
    * Function rename/refactor with usage references
    * Go to definition/implementation
    * Go to documentation
    * Go to usages
    * Code snippet library
* Debugger
    * Just a functioning debugger for any language would be fine! Step in, step over, change variable values as it goes, etc.
* REPL
    * A REPL for each language and automatically loads the file/project that I'm dealing with
* Writing
    * Spell checker
    * Dictionary
* Terminal
    * Multiplexing easily inside the interface and even saving state
* Project management
    * Can open each project and manage them here and there with a separate workspace for each
    * Save sessions/snapshots for each project
