# Hello there!

I love studying about new things and always seem to be studying about "How to start X" and finding the optimal pathway by studying it upfront too much. Programming is another endeavor that makes me wake up in the morning or makes me go to sleep late. Because of the ability to create something from scratch, I always try to find problems, so-called startup ideas and try to make something people want. I try to question things that most people know as facts. Most of the time, those so-called facts turn out to be false and the solutions are so counterintuitive that it would be hard to know unless you actually experience it. The reason I do that is that I lived a life too long by these so-called facts so I spend a large amount of time trying to know myself and be self-aware.
