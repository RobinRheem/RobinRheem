# Round Neovim

This is my neovim setup. It's a work in progress at the moment but I have some plans. The config's going to be in Lua because I want to learn it since it has other uses like NGINX modules, Roblox modules, etc. Also it's an opportunity for me to learn every aspect of the vim editor plus it's time for me to more productive by making less keystrokes instead of just `hjkl`ing everywhere. After all, everything's about being self-aware of the number of my keystrokes.
