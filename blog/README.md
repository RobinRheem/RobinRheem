# Blog

I'll be putting up all of my projects and thoughts over here.

## Features

- About me section
- Blog section
- Project section

Maybe I should have a home section where I summarize all the things above? This blog will be created with a static-site generator that I made in `Haskell`. There's a book on learning `Haskell` by making a little static-site generator so I'll get some ground up on there and keep on refactoring until I can open source this one! I hope to make a really nice theme that's really good for project sharing, blogging, and introducing oneself on the internet.
